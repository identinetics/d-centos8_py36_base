= Docker Base Image for Centos 7 + Python 3

The centos7_base image is extended with EPEL python3.4 and various utilities for administrative fact finding.

This builds an image that can be used in other build environments with different deployment requirements.
E.g. the development env relies on a direct internet connection for various repositories,
whereas the production env is proxied on both http and package manager level.
